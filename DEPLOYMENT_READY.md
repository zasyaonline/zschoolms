## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Free Tier Limitations
- **Backend sleeps:** After 15 minutes of inactivity
- **Wake time:** 30-60 seconds on first request
- **Database:** Expires after 90 days (Render free tier)
- **Perfect for:** Testing and demos
- **Not for:** Production (upgrade to paid tier)

### Security Best Practices
- ✅ Never commit `.deployment-secrets.txt` to git
- ✅ Use different secrets for production vs development
- ✅ Enable 2FA on all deployment accounts
- ✅ Regularly rotate JWT secrets
- ✅ Monitor logs for suspicious activity

### Before Going Live
- [ ] Test all critical user flows
- [ ] Verify error handling works
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Test with different browsers
- [ ] Share with team for feedback
- [ ] Monitor first few days closely

---

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Troubleshooting
1. Check the **Troubleshooting** section in `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
2. Review deployment logs in respective dashboards
3. Use browser DevTools to inspect errors
4. Check environment variables are set correctly

### Common Issues
- **CORS errors:** Update `FRONTEND_URL` in backend
- **API not found:** Check `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in frontend
- **Database errors:** Verify migrations ran successfully
- **Build fails:** Test `npm run build` locally first

---

## 🎉 Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Share URLs:**
   - Send to team members
   - Share with stakeholders
   - Get feedback from users

2. **Monitor:**
   - Check logs daily
   - Watch for errors
   - Monitor usage

3. **Iterate:**
   - Push updates to GitHub
   - Auto-deploy will handle rest
   - Test changes in production

4. **Plan Production:**
   - Evaluate paid tier needs
   - Consider custom domain
   - Plan data migration strategy
   - Set up monitoring tools
